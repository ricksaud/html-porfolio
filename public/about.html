<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ricardo Souto, a second-year college student diving into the world of software development. I believe that taking risks leads to the best rewards in life. While I'm new to the field and haven't gained professional experience yet, I'm passionate about learning and growing in this exciting area.

  I'm eager to explore opportunities in software development and open to connecting and learning from others in the field. Feel free to reach out to me here on LinkedIn or via email at ricksaud@outlook.ie . Let's chat and learn together!"
